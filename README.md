## About
This is a simple wrapper around the [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo)
library using Rust types. It also includes the current MediaInfo source as of (25.07). 

It is updated to reflect the full json format of the version.

The entire libmediainfo API is not exposed yet. The reason is basically because I don't
have a test case for the rest of the API.

Some information about the MediaInfo API can be found
[here](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Support/SDK), but not a lot of information is
available. The *exemples* directory has some basic use of the API.

## Examples
The examples can be run with:

```
cargo run --example [example_name]
```

for example:

```
cargo run --example basic_info
```

## Documentation
Yet to come.

## Requiments
### Rust
We target the most recent stable version (currently "1.17"). The best way to get it is
via `rustup` (or some bleeding edge Linux distro).

### MediaInfo Library
In Linux you should install libmediainfo (probably found in your distro package manager).
For Arch Linux users:

```
 # pacman -S libmediainfo
```

On Linux Mint 18 (and probably others ditros that use `apt`):

```
 # apt-get install libmediainfo
```

* Note: `libmediaifo` depends on `libstdc++`, but for some reason it was not installed
by `apt` in my test. After installing it the linker (`ld`) was still unable to link to
`stdc++` and I had to manually create a symbolic link to
`/usr/lib/x86-64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.s0.6`.

The wrapper was written against the version "0.7.94" (current version on Arch
repository).

We also depend on ```libc``` but it should be a dependency of ```libmediainfo```.

### pkg-config
Currently the build "script" only supports building with ```pkg-config```.
